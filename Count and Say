#The count-and-say sequence is a sequence of digit strings defined by the recursive formula:

#countAndSay(1) = "1"
#countAndSay(n) is the way you would "say" the digit string from countAndSay(n-1), which is then converted into a different digit string.
#To determine how you "say" a digit string, split it into the minimal number of groups so that each group is a contiguous section all of the same character. Then for each group, say the number of characters, then say the character. To convert the saying into a digit string, replace the counts with a number and concatenate every saying.

    def countAndSay(self, n: int) -> str:

        cur = ""

        counts = 0
        saidString = self.countAndSay(n-1)
        for i in saidString:
            if not cur:
                cur = i
                counts+=1
            else:

                    counts+=1

                    res = res + str(counts) + cur
                    counts = 1
                    cur = i
        res = res + str(counts) + i
